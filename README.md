# Monitoring---rainfall-system
The primary goal of this project is to predict natural disasters in advance using machine learning and statistical models applied to historical data. By integrating Geographic Information System (GIS) data on tectonic plates and past earthquakes, the model aims to forecast future earthquakes and tsunamis.
